# School-admission-form

##About the website
####The website is designed for the school admission process and features the details of a school named 'Masti ki Paathshala.' Parents or students can conveniently fill out the admission form at their convenience through the website.

The website includes a secure admin login, providing access to the admission department of the school. Upon successful login with the correct credentials, the home page will display a list of all received admission forms.

The admin interface allows the admission department to review and take action on each admission form, either by approving or rejecting them. The hamburger menu provides easy navigation to view the available application forms, the ones that have been approved, and those that have been rejected.

The primary goal of this website is to streamline the admission form process, making it easier for both parents and the admission committee.
